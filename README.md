# AI3

This program can be run with the command  `python test_chess.py`

If different AIs or recursion depths are desired, please comment, uncomment, and adjust values in test_chess.py. If you want to change the move reordering, the corresponding instance variable of the AlphaBetaAI will have to be changed.
